package sum

// An interesting property of arrays is that the size is encoded in its type. If you try to pass an [4]int into a function that expects [5]int, it won't compile. They are different types so it's just the same as trying to pass a string into a function that wants an int.

		sum += number
	}

	var sums []int

		sums = append(sums, Sum(numbers))
